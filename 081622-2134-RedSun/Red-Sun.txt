Maybe we could want more 
Like for instance after instance, let it go
These things keep unfolding and unfolding its pepectual, you know \\
Oh, find me better for it, better for this \\
Oh, red sun in the morning, in the morning \\!

Ghost ride and I'm sideways but you follow \\
No side, let me fall off by tomorrow \\
Nose dive and we reform in the same sky \\
Low tide and we're reborn and who knows why? \\!

I'm on a swing back and forth whos hands, \\
Pull back the ground below, two feet land... \\!
